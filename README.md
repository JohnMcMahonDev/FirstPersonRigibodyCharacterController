This is a rigidbody player controller with just the core functionality any player controller needs. Includes walking, crouching, sprinting, jumping, stepping, footstep sound support, and an optional stamina system. This controller was built to be a foundation to be built upon, but can also be used on its own. 

Anyone is free to use this in any way they see fit.
